# Numerical Simulation
Numerical analysis scheme (currently) using _Lax-Friedrich_ Numerical Flux and _u_xxx discretization_


# Steps to run: -
  1. Make sure you have **Python**, **matplotlib** and **C/C++** installed;
     
  2. Clone / Download this git repository into your _working directory_ (Make sure the Python script and C++ file are in the **same** directory);  **/~ OR ~/**  Download the _**FV_KdV.cpp and matplot.py**_ files into a (same) directory;
    
  3. Run the **C++** file (All the _data dump txt files_ will be automatically created in the same directory and the _matplotlib_ script will automatically show the plot)
